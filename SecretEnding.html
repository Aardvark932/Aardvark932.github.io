            I'm surprised. I did not know that this button was not hidden. More importantly, I'm surprised that you're still here.  
            I thought Adam had made the website so ugly you had to leave. Also, I'm sure he put 8 ways to leave his website.  
            Well, you have made it. You can stay on this page, away from those things in the 'GET OUT' page.  
            You are safe now. You have made it out. You are with the angels.
            Or you can press 'Alt' and then press 'F4'.
