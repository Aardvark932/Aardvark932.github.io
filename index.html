    <h1>Welcome to the worst website in existence.</h1>
    <p>
        This website exists for one reason: to test your patience. It is an assault on your eyes, ears, and very soul. 
        If you value your sanity, you should leave <strong>immediately</strong>. Below is a list of ways to escape. 
        Some are easy. Some are... questionable.
    </p>

    <h2>Ways to Leave This Hellscape:</h2>
    <div class="leave-container">
        <a href="GullibleEnding.html" class="big-obvious-button">LEAVE HERE!</a>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Look for a button above...</li>
        <li>Alt + F4.</li>
        <li>Smash your device with a hammer.</li>
        <li>Throw your phone/laptop into a deep lake.</li>
        <li>Pull the power cord out of your computer.</li>
        <li>Close your eyes and pretend this never happened.</li>
        <li>Summon a demon to consume this webpage.</li>
        <li>Sell your soul to escape.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        But if you're still reading this... you clearly haven't tried hard enough. Why are you still here? Do you... 
        actually like this? Thatâ€™s worrying. You're wasting your time. You're wasting your life. Go away. Leave. Please.
